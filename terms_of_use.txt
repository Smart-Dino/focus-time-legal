1. Use of the App

The Deep Wave Focus app is provided for personal, non-commercial use on iOS devices. You may use the App only in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws.

You agree not to:

All content you create—including block lists, schedules, and settings—is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, access, transmit, or share any personal data or app usage information.

While the App interacts with iOS Screen Time to enforce blocks, we cannot guarantee the behavior of third-party apps or prevent system-level changes outside the App. You are solely responsible for the management and use of your block lists.
